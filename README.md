# Fingerprinting LLMs

This project explores methods to **fingerprint large language models (LLMs)** by analyzing statistical and structural properties of generated text.  This is a project for the Mathematics Senior Seminar at UML.

The aim is twofold:
1. **Detection** — distinguish LLM-generated text from human-written text.  
2. **Attribution** — identify which LLM may have produced a given text sample.

The approach combines techniques from **stylometry, information theory, and signal processing** identify patterns that are subtle for humans but systematic for models.
